# MixingCalcs
This repository contains Python notebooks used for my senior thesis research. The notebooks are in Google Colab, so a native installation of Python is not necessary. In order to use either of the mixing mixing codes, download the accompanyig data_processor.py file in the same folder as the notebooks. Or, if on Google Colab, download the data_processor.py file on your computer and be sure to upload the file to the runtime folder. Refer to the accompanying file, derivation.pdf, for an explantion of the mixinf models.
*If you prefer to process your own data, then the data_processor.py file is not necessary.*

Further explantion on the project will be added here soon, but for now here are the codes...
