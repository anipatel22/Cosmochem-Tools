# Cosmochem-Tools
This repository contains python tools relevant to research at the cross section of cosmochemistry and nuclear astrophysics.

data_processor.py contains functions that are useful in processing isotopic data. Cosmochemists often work with isotopic data normalized to some standard (delta, epsilon, and mu notation). Astrophysicits and astronmers work with mass fraction ratios (not normalized to any standard). This module contains functions which convert between the two data formats (taking lists as inputs). It also contains functions to get absolute mass fractions in a sample from mass fraction ratios and vice versa. Will be updated with additional relevant functions in the future.
